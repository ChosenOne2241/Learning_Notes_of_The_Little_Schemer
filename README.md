# The-Little-Schemer-Learning-Notes
The project contains almost all scripts from The Little Schemer written by myself; plus, I added extra comments just for myself as a reminder. :)

The introduction to this textbook is here: http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-schemer

Scheme interpreter I use is called Petite Chez Scheme, which is available here: http://www.scheme.com/petitechezscheme.html

Enjoy it!
