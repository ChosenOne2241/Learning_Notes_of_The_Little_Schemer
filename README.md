# Learning Notes of The Little Schemer

The project comprises nearly all code from [*The Little Schemer*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-schemer-fourth-edition, "The Little Schemer, fourth edition"); besides, I inserted extra comments for easier comprehension after modifying the original code subtly to be compatible with [Chez Scheme 9.5](https://www.scheme.com/index.html "(chez (chez scheme))") syntax.

Feel free to use and enjoy it!
