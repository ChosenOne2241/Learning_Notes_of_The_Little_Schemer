# The-Little-Schemer-Learning-Notes
The project contains almost all Scheme scripts from The Little Schemer (4th Edition) written by myself; plus, I added extra comments just for myself as a reminder. :)

Scheme interpreter I use is called Petite Chez Scheme, which is available here: http://www.scheme.com/petitechezscheme.html

Enjoy it!
