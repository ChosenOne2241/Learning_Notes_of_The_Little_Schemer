# Learning Notes of The Little Schemer

The project contains almost all programs from *The Little Schemer* written by myself; plus, I added some extra comments just for myself to understand. :)

The introduction to this interesting textbook is [here](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-schemer "The Little Schemer, fourth edition").

And the Scheme interpreter I use is called [Petite Chez Scheme](http://www.scheme.com/petitechezscheme.html "Petite Chez Scheme").

Free to use and enjoy it!
